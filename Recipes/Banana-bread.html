<h2>   Description              </h2>  </div>

   <p> Banana bread first became a standard feature of American cookbooks with the popularization of baking soda and baking powder in the 1930s. It appeared in Pillsbury's 1933 Balanced Recipes cookbook,[2] and later gained more acceptance with the release of the original Chiquita Banana's Recipe Book in 1950

  </p>

   <p> National Banana Bread day is February 23.[4] Bananas appeared in the US in the 1870s and it took a while for them to appear as ingredient items for desserts.[5] The modern banana bread recipe[6] began being published in cookbooks around the 1930s and its popularity was greatly helped by the introduction of baking powder on the market.
